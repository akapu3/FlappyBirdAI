# FlappyBirdAI

FlappyBirdAI is a Flappy Bird-inspired game enhanced with artificial intelligence. This project utilizes Object-Oriented Programming principles to create a dynamic and efficient game while leveraging the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to train neural networks that autonomously play the game.

## Features

- Object-Oriented Design – Structured code to ensure modularity and reusability.
- Animated Game Elements – Smooth animations for the bird and base.
- Pixel Perfect Collision – Uses collision masks for precise hit detection.
- Efficient Base Rendering – Implements a cyclic pattern for the moving base instead of rendering new images infinitely, improving performance.
- AI-Powered Gameplay – Integrates the NEAT algorithm to train neural networks, enabling the AI to play Flappy Bird autonomously.
- Getting Started
- Prerequisites

## Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- NEAT-Python

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FlappyBirdAI.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd FlappyBirdAI
3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the program: python flappyBird.py

## How It Works
The game environment is built using Pygame. The NEAT algorithm evolves neural networks over multiple generations to optimize AI gameplay. The AI learns by adjusting weights and biases in its neural network through evolutionary processes.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing additional training parameters for improved AI performance.
- Enhancing graphics and adding sound effects.
- Adding visualization of the AI learning progress to the game itself rather than the terminal.
